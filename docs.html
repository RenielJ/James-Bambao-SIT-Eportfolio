            <p class="col-lg-10 fs-4">During my On-the-Job Training, my core functions primarily involved monitoring the academic performance of DOST-SEI undergraduate scholars. I was responsible for processing their enrollment and ensuring their financial assistance was handled according to policies and government accounting and auditing rules, covering aspects such as monthly stipends, book allowances, and other school fees. I meticulously prepared periodic reports, ensuring the accuracy of the submitted data and updating and maintaining the undergraduate scholars' database at TUP-Taguig. Additionally, I updated and verified LBP requirements for the E-card processing of new scholars and provided assistance by encoding scholarship-related data for new JLSS scholars in their third year.</p>

Through these diverse tasks, I gained a comprehensive understanding of the administrative and support functions essential to the effective management of the scholarship program.</p>
